    Nonparametric regression with Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) [2]_.

    Regress `y_train` on `x_train` with a latent mean function represented as
    a sum of decision trees. The inference is carried out by sampling the
    posterior distribution of the tree ensemble with an MCMC.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x_train
        The training predictors.
    y_train
        The training responses.
    x_test
        The test predictors.
    type
        The type of regression. 'wbart' for continuous regression, 'pbart' for
        binary regression with probit link.
    sparse
        Whether to activate variable selection on the predictors as done in
        [1]_.
    theta
    a
    b
    rho
        Hyperparameters of the sparsity prior used for variable selection.

        The prior distribution on the choice of predictor for each decision rule
        is

        .. math::
            (s_1, \ldots, s_p) \sim
            \operatorname{Dirichlet}(\mathtt{theta}/p, \ldots, \mathtt{theta}/p).

        If `theta` is not specified, it's a priori distributed according to

        .. math::
            \frac{\mathtt{theta}}{\mathtt{theta} + \mathtt{rho}} \sim
            \operatorname{Beta}(\mathtt{a}, \mathtt{b}).

        If not specified, `rho` is set to the number of predictors p. To tune
        the prior, consider setting a lower `rho` to prefer more sparsity.
        If setting `theta` directly, it should be in the ballpark of p or lower
        as well.
    varprob
        The probability distribution over the `p` predictors for choosing a
        predictor to split on in a decision node a priori. Must be > 0. It does
        not need to be normalized to sum to 1. If not specified, use a uniform
        distribution. If ``sparse=True``, this is used as initial value for the
        MCMC.
    xinfo
        A matrix with the cutpoins to use to bin each predictor. If not
        specified, it is generated automatically according to `usequants` and
        `numcut`.

        Each row shall contain a sorted list of cutpoints for a predictor. If
        there are less cutpoints than the number of columns in the matrix,
        fill the remaining cells with NaN.

        `xinfo` shall be a matrix even if `x_train` is a dataframe.
    usequants
        Whether to use predictors quantiles instead of a uniform grid to bin
        predictors. Ignored if `xinfo` is specified.
    rm_const
        How to treat predictors with no associated decision rules (i.e., there
        are no available cutpoints for that predictor). If `True` (default),
        they are ignored. If `False`, an error is raised if there are any.
    sigest
        An estimate of the residual standard deviation on `y_train`, used to set
        `lamda`. If not specified, it is estimated by linear regression (with
        intercept, and without taking into account `w`). If `y_train` has less
        than two elements, it is set to 1. If n <= p, it is set to the standard
        deviation of `y_train`. Ignored if `lamda` is specified.
    sigdf
        The degrees of freedom of the scaled inverse-chisquared prior on the
        noise variance.
    sigquant
        The quantile of the prior on the noise variance that shall match
        `sigest` to set the scale of the prior. Ignored if `lamda` is specified.
    k
        The inverse scale of the prior standard deviation on the latent mean
        function, relative to half the observed range of `y_train`. If `y_train`
        has less than two elements, `k` is ignored and the scale is set to 1.
    power
    base
        Parameters of the prior on tree node generation. The probability that a
        node at depth `d` (0-based) is non-terminal is ``base / (1 + d) **
        power``.
    lamda
        The prior harmonic mean of the error variance. (The harmonic mean of x
        is 1/mean(1/x).) If not specified, it is set based on `sigest` and
        `sigquant`.
    tau_num
        The numerator in the expression that determines the prior standard
        deviation of leaves. If not specified, default to ``(max(y_train) -
        min(y_train)) / 2`` (or 1 if `y_train` has less than two elements) for
        continuous regression, and 3 for binary regression.
    offset
        The prior mean of the latent mean function. If not specified, it is set
        to the mean of `y_train` for continuous regression, and to
        ``Phi^-1(mean(y_train))`` for binary regression. If `y_train` is empty,
        `offset` is set to 0. With binary regression, if `y_train` is all
        `False` or `True`, it is set to ``Phi^-1(1/(n+1))`` or
        ``Phi^-1(n/(n+1))``, respectively.
    w
        Coefficients that rescale the error standard deviation on each
        datapoint. Not specifying `w` is equivalent to setting it to 1 for all
        datapoints. Note: `w` is ignored in the automatic determination of
        `sigest`, so either the weights should be O(1), or `sigest` should be
        specified by the user.
    num_trees
        The number of trees used to represent the latent mean function.
    numcut
        If `usequants` is `False`: the exact number of cutpoints used to bin the
        predictors, ranging between the minimum and maximum observed values
        (excluded).

        If `usequants` is `True`: the maximum number of cutpoints to use for
        binning the predictors. Each predictor is binned such that its
        distribution in `x_train` is approximately uniform across bins. The
        number of bins is at most the number of unique values appearing in
        `x_train`, or ``numcut + 1``.

        Before running the algorithm, the predictors are compressed to the
        smallest integer type that fits the bin indices, so `numcut` is best set
        to the maximum value of an unsigned integer type, like 255.

        Ignored if `xinfo` is specified.
    ndpost
        The number of MCMC samples to save, after burn-in. `ndpost` is the
        total number of samples across all chains. `ndpost` is rounded up to the
        first multiple of `mc_cores`.
    nskip
        The number of initial MCMC samples to discard as burn-in. This number
        of samples is discarded from each chain.
    keepevery
        The thinning factor for the MCMC samples, after burn-in.
    printevery
        The number of iterations (including thinned-away ones) between each log
        line. Set to `None` to disable logging. ^C interrupts the MCMC only
        every `printevery` iterations, so with logging disabled it's impossible
        to kill the MCMC conveniently.
    num_chains
        The number of independent Markov chains to run.

        The difference between ``num_chains=None`` and ``num_chains=1`` is that
        in the latter case in the object attributes and some methods there will
        be an explicit chain axis of size 1.
    num_chain_devices
        The number of devices to spread the chains across. Must be a divisor of
        `num_chains`. Each device will run a fraction of the chains.
    num_data_devices
        The number of devices to split datapoints across. Must be a divisor of
        `n`. This is useful only with very high `n`, about > 1000_000.

        If both num_chain_devices and num_data_devices are specified, the total
        number of devices used is the product of the two.
    devices
        One or more devices used to run the MCMC on. If not specified, the
        computation will follow the placement of the input arrays. If a list of
        devices, this argument can be longer than the number of devices needed.
    seed
        The seed for the random number generator.
    maxdepth
        The maximum depth of the trees. This is 1-based, so with the default
        ``maxdepth=6``, the depths of the levels range from 0 to 5.
    init_kw
        Additional arguments passed to `bartz.mcmcstep.init`.
    run_mcmc_kw
        Additional arguments passed to `bartz.mcmcloop.run_mcmc`.
