    Run the MCMC for the BART posterior.

    Parameters
    ----------
    key
        A key for random number generation.
    bart
        The initial MCMC state, as created and updated by the functions in
        `bartz.mcmcstep`. The MCMC loop uses buffer donation to avoid copies,
        so this variable is invalidated after running `run_mcmc`. Make a copy
        beforehand to use it again.
    n_save
        The number of iterations to save.
    n_burn
        The number of initial iterations which are not saved.
    n_skip
        The number of iterations to skip between each saved iteration, plus 1.
        The effective burn-in is ``n_burn + n_skip - 1``.
    inner_loop_length
        The MCMC loop is split into an outer and an inner loop. The outer loop
        is in Python, while the inner loop is in JAX. `inner_loop_length` is the
        number of iterations of the inner loop to run for each iteration of the
        outer loop. If not specified, the outer loop will iterate just once,
        with all iterations done in a single inner loop run. The inner stride is
        unrelated to the stride used for saving the trace.
    callback
        An arbitrary function run during the loop after updating the state. For
        the signature, see `Callback`. The callback is called under the jax jit,
        so the argument values are not available at the time the Python code is
        executed. Use the utilities in `jax.debug` to access the values at
        actual runtime. The callback may return new values for the MCMC state
        and the callback state.
    callback_state
        The initial custom state for the callback.
    burnin_extractor
    main_extractor
        Functions that extract the variables to be saved respectively in the
        burnin trace and main traces, given the MCMC state as argument. Must
        return a pytree, and must be vmappable.

    Returns
    -------
    A namedtuple with the final state, the burn-in trace, and the main trace.

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        If `run_mcmc` detects it's being invoked in a `jit`-wrapped context and
        with settings that would create unrolled loops in the trace.

    Notes
    -----
    The number of MCMC updates is ``n_burn + n_skip * n_save``. The traces do
    not include the initial state, and include the final state.
